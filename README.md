# DraftkiReact
A League of Legends character selection simulator.

# How It Works
1. Click the start button to start the draft. This will trigger the timer to start counting down and enables teams to lock in their character choices.
2. Click on a champion icon in the middle of the screen. 
3. Click the LockIn button to lock in champion choice.

# What I Learned
* Developed a user interface using Bootstrap.
* Implemented a timer that counts down from 30 seconds and resets back to 0.
* Implemented a LockButton that allows the teams to lock in their champion choice.
